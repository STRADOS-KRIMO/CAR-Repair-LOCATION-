QBCore Multi-Location Vehicle Repair Script

A simple, optimized repair script for QBCore that supports multiple locations, synchronized vehicle fixes, progress bars, and custom sounds.

🛠 Configuration Guide

All primary settings are located at the top of the cl_repair.lua file.

1. How to Change or Add Locations

The script uses a table called repairLocations. Each entry is a vector3 coordinate (X, Y, Z).

To change an existing location: Replace the numbers inside the vector3().

To add a new location: Add a comma after the last entry and insert a new vector3.

local repairLocations = {
    vector3(100.72, 6534.53, 31.51),  -- Location 1
    vector3(-355.73, -1362.34, 30.83), -- Location 2
    vector3(123.45, 678.90, 12.34)    -- New Location Example
}


2. How to Change the Price

Locate the repairPrice variable. Changing this value updates both the cost logic and the map blip labels automatically.

local repairPrice = 1500 -- Change this number to your desired cost


3. How to Change the Blip Icon

The map icon is controlled by the SetBlipSprite function.

Find the line: SetBlipSprite(blip, 402)

Replace 402 with a different ID from the GTAV Blip List.

402: Wrench (Current)

446: Alternate Wrench

100: Gold Mine

4. How to Change the Sound

The script plays car_repair.ogg simultaneously with the progress bar.

Ensure your sound file is in interact-sound/client/html/sounds/car_repair.ogg.

To use a different file name, change this line in cl_repair.lua:

TriggerServerEvent('InteractSound_SV:PlayWithinDistance', 10.0, 'your_new_file_name', 0.5)
